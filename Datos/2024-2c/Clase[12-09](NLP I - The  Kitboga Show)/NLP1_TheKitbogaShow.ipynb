want your money then you need to do as i say you are not my teacher no no no no no no no [Applause] i've been calling scammers for over three years now and although i've had some pretty exciting and interesting learning experiences and just all around crazy moments this has to be the most extreme raw anger that i have ever witnessed the entire call took place over a couple days 10 hours worth of phone calls and ultimately ended in a pretty exciting display of anger it started off like a typical refund scam where they pose as a company like microsoft offering to give you money back for something you purchased they lock your computer and then pretend to transfer money to your bank account you never used our service at once but you paid 399 dollars two years back so we have to refund that money to you okay you know sometimes i feel like life is a lot like chess sometimes you do you don't realize that you're just right now just go ahead and type the name of your why do i have to go to my bank uh you don't have to give me any of your personal information you don't need to worry about it as this call has been recorded for the policing purposes right you just need to go ahead and accept the money transfer what we are going to do that's it if you tell any of your personal details over this call i might lose my job because i am dealing with you and we have some protocols which we need to follow oh gosh well i'll be sure not to say anything personal then yeah i wouldn't want you to lose your job there that would be that would be bad thank you your computer is acting like really weird sometimes you know oh i think this guy is very suspicious uh he tried to do a bank right he tried to log in like without any credentials and stuff yeah why okay do you have a username and a password um well i can't give you any personal information over the phone i understand you need not tell me anything all right after you log in just let me know do not tell me anything just give me a second working on you i'm working on your case only and i'm not touching any other customer okay just bear with me oh okay sorry i'm just not familiar with the how these things work i'll keep quiet just go ahead and write down the available balance of your account okay you want me to write down okay yes yes so that after i give you the money you can you know by adding it up you can always proceed that if you have received the money or not i could just write down the balance of this everything with this paper and before i hang on out of curiosity by a raise how many of you have been expecting money into your bank account and the way that you verify whether or not you got it is by writing down your previous balance account how many because i've never done that i just look at the transaction history while scammers are on your computer they often use something like this to hide your screen and then they'll transfer money in between your accounts or edit the html to make it look like you have more money than you're supposed to it's all part of their tricks up some coffee for my husband when he gets back he likes it he likes it extra sloppy i understand do you ever put eggs in your coffee never it's like a quick way to eat breakfast you know you get it all done all at once just put a raw egg in there a little mayonnaise whip it up all right [Music] a little bit hard to see it is it fine now i mean the text okay write down your name it says enter your name enter the name and do not hit enter okay just enter the name i need to go i need to go back to the kitchen and finish up my how how much longer is this going to take i hate to be wrong what only two minutes that's it two minutes you just need to fill up this form and get your money that's it okay so just enter the name okay we are running out of time can you please make it bigger so i can read it please it says please enter your name okay so just enter the name from the keyboard and do not hit enter okay just enter the name i wish they didn't make things complicated i thought computers were supposed to make things easier you know not harder like this now enter your phone number and please do not hit enter after this again do not okay if i hit enter yeah now just enter the zip code that's a little that's my personal information i can't say that over the phone then hit enter so many zeros ma'am how much of money did you transfer it says check your bank oh my god oh my god forty thousand dollars what are you talking about mom oh just let me check your microphone give me a moment i can't say anything hold on go back hey i'm going back hold on hold on hold on i can't think i can't see i can't see oh oh god okay just pause panic okay oh sweet baby jesus the scam is to try to make you think that it's not the 400. hello hello hold on hold on i'm unplugging the computer you can see the computer now i unplugged the computer that way the transfer won't go through right now okay i'm back hello ma'am what do you see on your screen i unplugged the computer that way the transfer wouldn't go through i don't want 400 000 why are you yelling at me young man i i'm trying to help you no i turned the computer off i don't want that money to go through i'm telling you we can't get it why are you yelling at me is the computer is the computer on paula is the computer on are you in front of the computer [Applause] stop yelling at me i'm joining i am sorry i am sorry come back come [Music] i'm really sorry paula it's my mistake i'm sorry it's just that you you transferred the money to me no why did you do this my mistake oh why would you take me [Applause] [Music] is when i get angry give me a minute how do you destroy a computer what's the fastest way i'll make sure this doesn't happen if you destroy the computer you lose your money okay you lose your damn money hello hello hello hold on honey hold on do you know anything that you are gonna lose and you are gonna beg hello i'm trying to work i'm not strong enough i'm trying honey i'm trying to destroy the evidence but none of you need to turn on that computer listen to me [Applause] [Applause] i can't hear you you're not turn the damn computer on turn your computer on i mean i don't know if it's gonna turn on now or not hit it i hit the screen pretty hard but hold on i'm what you see what you did why did you break the computer come back and check your account the money went through first i might have to just check later i'm feeling a little stressed out right now to be honest with you i might have to take something i think i need to take something pills [Applause] to start relaxing you know for me sometimes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you have no money you remember right that you had 260 000 in your money market i can't move my mouse at all i think there's something wrong hold on let me try i might have to turn it off and turn it back on again if it doesn't work right no uh let me just close it [Applause] hello i i just need to i think i need to take a break i turned the computer [Applause] is off all of the money was in my account and even though you tried to send 400 000 while you accidentally sent 400 000 it looks like it didn't go through so hopefully [Music] [Laughter] how is all my money going do you want your money back yes or no no no no no yes yes yes do you hear me yes

and everything okay honey we'll get this figured out it seems like my husband's okay with it all right this is good i can get you the account ma'am click on man click on forgot password you need to open his email and click i think i might just leave the call right there to be honest if we never talk to him again i feel like we accomplished a lot in that we spent 10 hours with him we we heard rage like i've never heard before and it was an experience that i likely will never forget so far i haven't heard from steve i don't know if he's just letting his voice heal or rethinking everything about his life i don't know if this will be an experience that makes steve think twice about what he's doing but i hope that you had the opportunity to learn from this and get a couple laughs at his expense thank you so much and as always know that you are loved valued and appreciated i'll see the next video [Music] hello okay\")]"
